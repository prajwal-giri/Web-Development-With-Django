    <h1>Python (programming language)</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Python</b> is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming
      language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use
      of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its
      object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code
      for small and large-scale projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
      programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural),
      object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
      "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor
      to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python
      0.9.0.[33] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features,
      such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection
      system (in addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released in
      2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely
      backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in
      2020.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Python was conceived in the late 1980s[39] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum
      Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC
      programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[40] capable of exception
      handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its
      implementation began in December 1989.[41] Van Rossum shouldered sole
      responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018,
      when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as
      Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community
      bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's
      chief decision-maker.[42] In January 2019, active Python core developers
      elected a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.[43][44]
      Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features,
      including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference
      counting) for memory management and support for Unicode.[45] Python 3.0
      was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language
      that is not completely backward-compatible.[46] Many of its major features
      were backported to Python 2.6.x[47] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of
      Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of
      Python 2 code to Python 3.[48] Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially
      set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of
      existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[49][50] No
      more security patches or other improvements will be released for
      it.[51][52] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[53] and later
      are supported. Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[54] as all versions
      of Python (including 2.7[55]) had security issues, leading to possible
      remote code execution[56] and web cache poisoning.[57]
    </p>
    <h2>Design philosophy and features</h2>
    <p>
      Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented
      programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of
      its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented
      programming (including by metaprogramming[58] and metaobjects (magic
      methods)).[59] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions,
      including design by contract[60][61] and logic programming.[62] Python
      uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a
      cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[63] It also
      features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and
      variable names during program execution. Python's design offers some
      support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has
      filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets,
      and generator expressions.[64] The standard library has two modules
      (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from
      Haskell and Standard ML.[65] The language's core philosophy is summarized
      in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such
      as:[66]
    </p>
    <h2>Syntax and semantics</h2>
    <p>
      Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is
      visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other
      languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use
      curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are
      allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions
      and special cases than C or Pascal.[76]
    </p>

    <h3>Indentation</h3>
    <p>
      Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or
      keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after
      certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the
      current block.[77] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately
      represents the program's semantic structure.[78] This feature is sometimes
      termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most
      languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. The recommended
      indent size is four spaces.[79]
    </p>
    <h3>Statements and control flow</h3>
    <p>
      Python's statements include (among others): The assignment statement,
      using a single equals sign =. The if statement, which conditionally
      executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of
      else-if). The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object,
      capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
      The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its
      condition is true. The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in
      its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it
      also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run
      regardless of how the block exits. The raise statement, used to raise a
      specified exception or re-raise a caught exception. The class statement,
      which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a
      class, for use in object-oriented programming. The def statement, which
      defines a function or method. The with statement, which encloses a code
      block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the
      block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file
      and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization
      (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[80] The
      break statement, exits from a loop. The continue statement, skips this
      iteration and continues with the next item. The del statement, removes a
      variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted
      and trying to use that variable will cause an error. A deleted variable
      can be reassigned. The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is
      syntactically needed to create an empty code block. The assert statement,
      used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. The yield
      statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is
      also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines. The return
      statement, used to return a value from a function. The import statement,
      which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used
      in the current program. The assignment statement (=) operates by binding a
      name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. Variables
      may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a
      variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data
      type associated with it. However, at a given time, a variable will refer
      to some object, which will have a type. This is referred to as dynamic
      typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages,
      where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. Python does
      not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and,
      according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[81][82] However, better
      support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending
      Python's generators.[83] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators;
      information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python
      2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function,
      and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack
      levels.[84]
    </p>
    <h3>Expressions</h3>
    <p>
      Some Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C
      and Java, while some are not: Addition, subtraction, and multiplication
      are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of
      divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) // and
      floating-point/division.[85] Python also uses the ** operator for
      exponentiation. From Python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced.
      It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix
      multiplication.[86][87] From Python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the "walrus
      operator", was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a
      larger expression.[88] In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which
      compares numerics by value[89] and objects by reference.[90] (Value
      comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.)
      Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison
      by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b
      <=c. Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather
      than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C. Python has a type of
      expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general
      expression termed a generator expression.[64] Anonymous functions are
      implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that
      the body can only be one expression. Conditional expressions in Python are
      written as x if c else y[91] (different in order of operands from the c ?
      x : y operator common to many other languages). Python makes a distinction
      between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and
      cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be
      immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and
      thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the
      tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples,
      which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new
      tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the
      variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t=t + (4, 5) first
      evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned
      back to t, thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of t, while
      conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are
      optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[92] Python features sequence
      unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that
      can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated
      in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are
      put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement.
      The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the
      equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided
      writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it,
      assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on
      the left.[93] Python has a "string format" operator %. This functions
      analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. "spam=%s eggs=%d" %
      ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2" . In Python 3 and 2.6+, this
      was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. "spam={0}
      eggs={1}" .format("blah", 2). Python 3.6 added "f-strings" : blah="blah" ;
      eggs=2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'.[94] Strings in Python can be
      concatenated, by "adding" them (same operator as for adding integers and
      floats). E.g. "spam" + "eggs" returns "spameggs" . Even if your strings
      contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers.
      E.g. "2" + "2" returns "22" . Python has various kinds of string literals:
      Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells,
      Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote
      marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\) as
      an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6
      as "formatted string literals" .[94] Triple-quoted strings, which begin
      and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span
      multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby.
      Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r.
      Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where
      literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and
      Windows-style paths. Compare "@-quoting" in C#. Python has array index and
      array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or
      a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are
      relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but
      not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or
      stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be
      omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element
      of a slice is a shallow copy. In Python, a distinction between expressions
      and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as
      Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some
      functionality. For example: List comprehensions vs. for-loops Conditional
      expressions vs. if blocks The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in
      Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter
      is for statements. Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list
      and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions,
      cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment
      statement such as a=1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a
      conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C
      error of mistaking an assignment operator=for an equality operator==in
      conditions: if (c=1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably
      unintended) C code but if c=1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.
